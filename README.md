In this new era of electronics, we know the concept of e-learning which does not include the use of paper and pen.

In this e-learning system we can assign projects to students and can share documents more easily.

This system has three modules including student, faculties and Admin.  Students can login, view the things uploaded by the faculties, knowledge books, also send messages to faculties. 

Faculties can login and have access for viewing, uploading documents and projects.
Admin can login and manage the faculties and student details and also view projects.
Flask is an API of Python that allows us to build up web-applications. Flask’s framework is more explicit than Django’s framework and is also easier to learn because it has less base code to implement a simple web-Application. Flask is based on WSGI(Web Server Gateway Interface) toolkit and Jinja2 template engine.
